Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community 
so the current event i have choosen for this segment is SEMA

In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis)
so sema is a place were car inthuseist go to show of there builds like a really big youtubers go to show of there builds to like whistlin diesel he toook his charger to sema and it got some attention and thats really the gist of it all thye just go and regoister there mighty builds for the world to see anything from a old rustit out muscle car to a glossy jdm car to any other import out there on the market and sema can have a hudge impact on my community because it helps people to grow in there own creativity and it helps people think outside the box because they are exposed to new things like ideas that they got fomr other people and they can take and make improvements to there own builds becasue of somebodyelse idea's and more so yeah and it brings a lot of people togather to just hang out and make new friends and that helps a lot anmd python helps to make it all possible 

In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future
so one is you got to sell ticjest some how and you gotta need a program for that

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online
well some reasons why it is important to protect your personal information wether it be a project or something that is just as simple as a picture it can be dangerious if someone gets a hold of that information like they can sprerad it and use it for wrong and say your working on a project that can make you a lot of money say you send it to someon on accident they may figure it out and put it to work ands make money off of your idea and not credit you or say yourn abnk satatmnents and onther things they all can lead to bad things happning and thats not good and could lead to despesion so yeah 

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure
well according to the research i hav e done you can do the folling....Create an email address specifically for your GitHub account or other open source activities you can do that and you can also not be going on websites that you ani't got no business being on and just dont do stupid things with yuou gmail and also you can get a vpn and use that if you want but all an all don't be on insecure websites 

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now
ummm bot to my  i don't think so but if i were to share some information that i would veiw as to personal i would take it down and just hope no one saw it :] 

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy 
so im going to try to answer this to the best if my ablitty so you just don't post or say anything personal AT ALLL!!!!!! SO FOR THE MOST PART thats it i guess

some ways on how computer science has changed or made our lifes better is simple because they teache you to break down problems into smaller steps. When you're coding, you're often faced with complex problems and they also show that  Coding teaches you to think logically. Coding teaches you to be creative
so they just basically help you to think in a way that can help you solve problems left and right and they come inhandy for a lot of things and they also  enhances problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity and more  encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications and more they so say you in a situation were you have to find the problem all that coding stuff you learned will halp and it will take effect on your brain and make you think logiclly on something

some sensers on the spiro robot that i like are the mostion senser and the touchging sensers and the light sensers and the speed sensers 
one senser on thje robot that is alos very important is a light senser and that is souly because we need to see where the robot is and we kinda like to make funny faces on the robot and then make it do funny things for example when we where using them to infect each other we needed the faces to get all uky and gross and sick like thus we used the light senser
