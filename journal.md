some sensers on the spiro robot that i like are the mostion senser and the touchging sensers and the light sensers and the speed sensers 
one senser on thje robot that is alos very important is a light senser and that is souly because we need to see where the robot is and we kinda like to make funny faces on the robot and then make it do funny things for example when we where using them to infect each other we needed the faces to get all uky and gross and sick like thus we used the light senser
