Recently, a dangerous trend called the “Chromebook Challenge” has been circulating online. This involves inserting objects like pencils into USB ports, which can cause fires or destroy the device. As a digital citizen and future tech professional, how should we respond to trends that put people and property at risk? What responsibilities do we have when using school technology? How would you explain the real-world consequences of this behavior to someone who thinks it’s “just a joke”? 
so my thought on this whole trend is that people will do anything for clout nower days and its just getting sad becasue not only are they prompting to destoy school equipment that is bad but its just uncalled for and it sucks for the people who have to pay for those type of things and its just not right so for the most part its just very stupid and it needs to stop and i think its just poitless becasue your runing it for everyone becasue you want to look cool on tik tok and youtube

A challenge called “100 Men vs 1 Gorilla” went viral after a famous YouTuber suggested testing it. The idea: could 100 unarmed people defeat a silverback gorilla? Some people say yes with strategy; others say it’s impossible. 
so looking at the prompt i am lead to beilve that it wold be impossable and tha it would just be a complete waste of time because groillas are very strong creatures and can easily rip us apart in a matter of seconds Human muscles are about half and half, other apes all have more fast twitch than slow, but gorilla muscles are an incredible 85-plus-percent fast-twitch fibers — the most of any ape. So, pound for pound of muscle mass, they are much much much more powerful than we do and thats just proof enogh to show that we do not stand a chance well not a fair chance aginst that thing

Do you believe such bans are beneficial or detrimental to students?
so my oppinion on this is that they are wasting there time on something like this but it can be benifical for somethings like more peopel will have no choice but to learn and stuff like that it can help with addittudes and stuff but for the most part i think its not benifical becase they are tryiing to stop cyberbulling which is a big task to complete and just taking kids phones away while there at school really is not going to stop cyberbulling and that is the whole goal all there doing is delaying it because anybody with common sence something that is not so common no more will know that soemthing like this is not going to work and in a way its a waste of time but benifical becasue kids will have no choice but to learn Bans on books or cell phones in schools have both potential benefits and drawbacks for students

How might these policies influence student behavior, safety, and learning?
well for a while kids will just be mad well the ones that use there phone non-stop and yeah they will be mad and maybe through a fit and just whine like big babyes who lost there bottle and want it back and as for saftey they may do somethings to get there phones back or to get the ban lifted and they may rick there lifes for it which does not make any sense in any world 
Positive and inclusive policies can foster a safe and supportive environment, leading to improved behavior and academic outcomes.

If implemented in your school, how would you respond to such restrictions?
i problay be a bit ticked becasue i use my phone to watch videos and to listen to music so i can do my work and all that jazz but for the most part i most likely would not care i mean i came from metzger and they were trying to do the same thing and i still didn't listen i just didn't get caught don't get caught they can't punish you in any way

Students will be able to explain how artificial intelligence can support their learning by analyzing a real-world example of AI improving test scores in a Texas school.
so one way they can use AI in schools to help grade i that it can do a search and check what questions that the kids taking the test missed and with that information the teacher vcsn use it to help better the lession plans and how that lession can be teached and it can help a lot escpeically when its being used when its suposed to and yeah thats it for the mos part it is really helpful and what not

How are you feeling right now—mentally, emotionally, and physically?
so in terms of mental state i am doing good and im just chilling and im just vibing and just existing for now 

What’s been the most stressful part of school lately?
so the most hard part about school right now is the fact that people are getting lazy and anoying and i want the school to be done at this point but other then that im just exstinging right now
What are some things you do (or could do) to take care of yourself during stressful times? well i just chill read the bible and just play my games and chat with friends and family 

What’s one goal you have for the rest of the school year? How will you stay motivated to reach it?
so the goal is to not get summer school ofc and to stay motivated my grades becasue if i just stop caring then my stuff is gonna say HELP and well im going to have to move to mars becasue my mom is going to blow me up in to pieceas and there is going to be no more me im going to go boom  im going to be nuked 

who is someone you can talk to when you’re feeling overwhelmed? Why do you trust them?
so the person i talk to is god becaus he listens to me and he actully cares for me and another friend named cosmin we juist chill and vibe most of the time

March Madness, the annual NCAA basketball tournament, has increasingly integrated advanced technologies to enhance both gameplay and the fan experience. From the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting game outcomes to the implementation of augmented reality (AR) in broadcasting, technology is reshaping how we engage with sports. Reflect on how these technological advancements have influenced your perception of the tournament. Do you believe AI-driven predictions, such as those attempting to create perfect brackets, add excitement or detract from the unpredictability that makes March Madness thrilling? Additionally, consider the role of social media platforms and streaming services in transforming fan engagement during the tournament. How do these changes impact the traditional viewing experience and your connection to the games?”
so the technolgy they use in sports such as baskitbal it very important becasue they need to know the right information about the player on there teams they neeed the most acuate information about there players because in order to potenaly win they need to m ost accurate information and such and such becasue again the nned to best informatipon to make a descion and the ai helps by reading the players perfermace from there last games or from games they perfermed well in and it uses that to help the team make a descion and pick the players with the best shot and here is some information from the interanet AI only predicted a few upsets in the first round, like No. 10 Utah State seed beating No. 7 seed UCLA, even as upsets like that are pretty common. In addition, both had several No. 1 seeds advancing to the Final Four and that juist helps alot

What types of technology did you use most often?
so the tecnolgy i used the most was my phone and playstation becasue thats how i played with my friends

How did this technology help you, entertain you, or challenge you in some way? 
well the tec kept me from being bored and not chill    i was a chill guy for the whole spring break 

Can you connect any of your technology use to what we learn in this class? Think about problem-solving, coding, game development, app functionality, or other related skills.
well i can because some of the tec that i used had to deal with code and it literly needed code to functoin code like python and java script

How can technology be used to help educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth language?
so some ways that technology can help people with there langauge is that it exposes them to new language  and it shows the person that works there a new verity of different people that speak a certain way it also helps to teach the person worling there how to speak differently 

What are some potential benefits and challenges of integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources? 
so some challenges that may come from intergrating slang with normal talk is that it may take a while for people to talk the way they need to and 2 now all slang is good some slang are used as gang words and others are **affiliated** with other gangs and other stuff so other then the whole part of taking awhile and possibly maiking gang members mad and wanting to kill you for what you said that it 

Should schools or youth organizations formally track and teach appropriate slang to improve communication, or is it best left informal?
i would say yes and no primarily because one it would be a great idea if kids (respecfuly)so fliping stupid they use words that are bad and are already bad and can already land them the biggest beating of a life time and yeah but on the positive note it can help people comunicate with gen beta 

How might misunderstandings of slang impact interactions between adults and youth in schools, counseling, or mentoring programs?
well as i stated in the previous statements there is both a good side and a bad side of slang it there can be insuilts and there are compluments so it can be positive and negotive its just like basic english

one way that the nfl teams use AI they use it to determine how well the players are so that they can try to get them on the team it pretty much resembles the money bag movie were they use AI and othe data to determine if they want that pplayer incase they should go up for bids and that pretty much it they use the data to see how well they play and if they want them like its that simple and how much they costa nd how much there worth and if they can use them they also try not to make emoitonal descions so yeah thats why they use AI

1.Air Traffic Control Systems – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions? 
well one way that computers control the algorithms is simple they just monitor aircraft postions like they see were the plane is at and if needed they can tell the piolet to change postiions to avoid another plane or a object 
2.Automation & AI in Aviation – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making. 
well one way they help is by analyze data from aircraft sensors to predict potential failures before they occur they are really good at doing that unless there was a malfunction 
3.Software Errors & Bugs – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents? 
 these b ugs suck becasue incorrect coding, poor design, misinterpreted requirements, or insufficient testing and that all can lead to human death and thats not good thats very bad because we need our lives to live and enjoy and yeah errors like that can lead to much more serious problems 
 4.Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
  they playt a huge role in the aircraft industy because a frustration point in the aircraft can increased errors and decreased productivity and thats not good to have on a aircraft that flys in the sky with people on it you want the plane to be 100 percent not 30 or 50 
  5.Cybersecurity in Aviation – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
  so thats also not a good thing but a unauthorized interference with flight control systems, theft of flight navigation data, manipulation of maintenance operations, and compromise of air traffic control systems and thats not good because we need to be in control so that bad things like 9/11 don't happen again and once was enough for some people and thats it for the most part
  6.Big Data & Predictive Analytics – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?
 well these system would help alot for these reasons intelligent systems can pick up on patterns from data, like sensor readings or equipment performance, and flag potential dangers such as faulty machines or hazardous environments and as it says these systems can help prevet crashes before they even happen and to me thats crazy to know that there are systems helping to prevet bad crashes from happing 
 mustaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

How do you think government intervention impacts technology companies and their users?
well if the government thinks that your company is a security threat they will act and ban your platform and try to fix it and thye will work with you to fix the issue 

In your opinion, how could companies like TikTok address security concerns while continuing to operate globally?
well in tiktoks case they will have to sell it in oder for us to keep it and as for other companys ut can very in terms of adressing things like that because there is a verity of reasons to get something like tiktok banned so it can really very and each circum stans is different to it just depends on th eoptions whenn it come to adressing thingfs like that 

Imagine you’re a developer at TikTok working on a new feature to increase user privacy. Describe one feature or policy you would implement and why.
well one feature i wold add is a feature that make your phone taste like choclete and other tasty foods and even feet very sticky feet and very smelly feet and it would taste like washing ditergent and the litle drop dots that you put into the washer and the little balls that had the different stuff that you put into the dishwasher and that it will work ho0pefully and it might not blowup the phone (nfjksabvjhrefhvbfdhjvbhjfbvhdbnfvnhjbjhvcbhjvcbhgvdfihncvkjnbdfkgnfdbndfgigfibfiyduhbgkfhdhviyfdhgikhfdhgtdkjbndgiuhtiujnbgfhbkgdjfbngkhn not responsible for death if casued)

What lessons can you take from this situation to apply to your own projects in this course?
well make sure that it orignates in the U.S because the U.S does not like forgen stuff like tiktok well the government and just makes sure that it is well taken care of and others tuff like that

so as the industy shifts to AI there are somethings that we need to be awere of and thats the fact that some peopel may lose a job because AI has taken there place and that can be very sad and disheartning etc 
but i feel that this shift could cause a very bad thing because as people mindlessly switch to making a regular factorys to completly automated factorys that could put them in a tight spot and that being the reason that the fact tjhat they fired peopel and with people out of the job nobody can buy things and that would lead to a drop in sells and pretty much everyone who works will be effected and some others to not just the averge work man but yeah they need to be caerful of how much they want to puch this AI stuff

What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year 
well brain rot is a very talked about topic and it can have both a some what positive effect on children well its manily bad things like kids can't live with out and will throw a whole air rade or temper tantrum anmd thye will fight to the death for there little ipad or phoen just so they can watch there little skibdi toilet or there lanky box and other stupid contrent they consume for hours on end As the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours pass
and they just keep doign very silly things and some of the content they watch is just stupid and so pointles adn it is not even that good As the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours passAs the hours pass 
How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024
so the word slop can mean a verity of things like for example when i was siting at the lunch table my friends said get on slop which ment get on clas of clans or maybe they ment something eles by that mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang mustang \

In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?
yes it is possible just don't watch dumb things like coo coo mealon and other stuff like dumb things that not all that good because the main casue of brain rot is what you watch and how long you watch it because look at troy he screams and im not saying he has brain rot i have no clue and stuff i gusess just don't be silly you are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a pranksteryou are a prankster

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape the way we live and work. This week, research one recent development in AI or another emerging technology (e.g., quantum computing, renewable energy tech, AR/VR, etc.). Summarize what you learned and share your thoughts on how it could impact society, your future career, or daily life 
so somwthings that AI can help with for example
Self-driving cars these suckers can help us with so much say for example you pass out at the wheel and the car is in motion well say no more becasue the wheel has sene=cersd that can tell if your hand sare on the wheel and not and if your hands are not on it the car will breack sofly to wake you up and if your cionditions remain unresponsive then the car will pool over and sound a alarm to wake you up and 911 may be called in a case of emergency 

 What excites or concerns you about this technology
 somethings that concern me becasue as techonlgy takes over and everything becomes automated ans other stuff people will eventally get to fat and lazy kinda like how peopel will look in the future and how they look in the fith element thats really it and the fact that peopel will graduly get dumber i mean with youtube in the way and other things people will graduly get dumber and azy i mean is good but its also a bad thing 

 Can you think of an innovative way this technology could be used in your field of interest?
 well in the role of an embulance driver that can help a lot say that someone in the truck is having a seriuos issue that will require more then one person to treat but they still gotta go to the hospital or ER to properly treat the problem a self driving system will come in handy in a position like that becasue one the AI thats driving can take the best route to the ER to prevent a tragidy from  
occurring and loss of senity for that matter and it coud pentaly speed up the process it would take to save the person from when the driver would drive the bus so yeah very good i gusess 

What ethical considerations might need to be addressed as this technology evolves
well some ethical things to be brought to light is the fact even though a bot is driving a point in which a life is lost its and its not the robots fault there could have been a lot of trafic that day or the bus broke down and another one was to far out th things os that a casulty is still possable even in the hand of a AI and its importsnt to know that the self drivinf system is just doing what its prgramed to do and ofc you may have a malfuncation and stuff now that i can't defend but you get the point its still possable to die in the ahnds of a bot and thats it yurrrrr yurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrryurrrrr

Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community 
so the current event i have choosen for this segment is SEMA

In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis)
so sema is a place were car inthuseist go to show of there builds like a really big youtubers go to show of there builds to like whistlin diesel he toook his charger to sema and it got some attention and thats really the gist of it all thye just go and regoister there mighty builds for the world to see anything from a old rustit out muscle car to a glossy jdm car to any other import out there on the market and sema can have a hudge impact on my community because it helps people to grow in there own creativity and it helps people think outside the box because they are exposed to new things like ideas that they got fomr other people and they can take and make improvements to there own builds becasue of somebodyelse idea's and more so yeah and it brings a lot of people togather to just hang out and make new friends and that helps a lot anmd python helps to make it all possible 

In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future
so one is you got to sell ticjest some how and you gotta need a program for that

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online
well some reasons why it is important to protect your personal information wether it be a project or something that is just as simple as a picture it can be dangerious if someone gets a hold of that information like they can sprerad it and use it for wrong and say your working on a project that can make you a lot of money say you send it to someon on accident they may figure it out and put it to work ands make money off of your idea and not credit you or say yourn abnk satatmnents and onther things they all can lead to bad things happning and thats not good and could lead to despesion so yeah 

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure
well according to the research i hav e done you can do the folling....Create an email address specifically for your GitHub account or other open source activities you can do that and you can also not be going on websites that you ani't got no business being on and just dont do stupid things with yuou gmail and also you can get a vpn and use that if you want but all an all don't be on insecure websites 

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now
ummm bot to my  i don't think so but if i were to share some information that i would veiw as to personal i would take it down and just hope no one saw it :] 

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy 
so im going to try to answer this to the best if my ablitty so you just don't post or say anything personal AT ALLL!!!!!! SO FOR THE MOST PART thats it i guess

some ways on how computer science has changed or made our lifes better is simple because they teache you to break down problems into smaller steps. When you're coding, you're often faced with complex problems and they also show that  Coding teaches you to think logically. Coding teaches you to be creative
so they just basically help you to think in a way that can help you solve problems left and right and they come inhandy for a lot of things and they also  enhances problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity and more  encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications and more they so say you in a situation were you have to find the problem all that coding stuff you learned will halp and it will take effect on your brain and make you think logiclly on something

mechanic  fixes vehicles and replaces their parts for customers. some of the skills needed to be a mechanic are problem solving ike being able to find the problem and fix the problem and onther is attention to detail and that helps when it comees to doing a good job on the body becasue you would not wan tto give the customer back there car and there is dents in the body work and there are holes in the panal's and dirt and grime so the best thing to do is look at the car when it comes in and make sure that it stays that way when it leave smae thing for your work make ssur eif your doing a wireing job mak esure that you make the wires look pretty becaus eall that matters to the custimer and if you treat here stuff like it dose not matter well they are not going to come back to you anoher thing that really really matter is customer service and the reason why that matters so much is simply becase you want money well in order to get that you need to treat customers the same way you would want to be treated like feel there problems and you know be nice to them and aother thing is communication nothing gets done the right way or nothing gets done at all because you team mate dose not know what to do becaue they dont know where the problem is and they may work o the side of the car or part that is not even broken and can casue more prolbems thats why communication is so importat now time for education reqiurmentshigh school diploma or GED, enroll in a vocational or technical school, and consider obtaining ASE certification

so some reasons why following instructions are so important is simple because to get the best effect on a project or a assighnment it makse things easirer on the teacher and it is just important and you want a hugh grade it helps with that too and you make less mistakes when you follow the instuctions given by the teacher and you can gain more privlges and more that comes with that and thats what you want so folling instructions is very important so for example say your in a fire and a fire fighter gives you a set of instrcutions and those set of instructions mean your life you kinda need to use those insturction that he gave you and those instructions were take the left stair case top my left and go all thye way down across the street to the red mark and wait there for assistance so say you follow the first few steps like going down the stair case and you choose to goto the mcdonalds down the street one you may pass of becasue so  much smoke in your lungs or the officers may need toi collect a statement from you but say that you don't follow the first few steps and you go down the right staircase instaed of the left well friend you just killed yourself instructions are important!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

some sensers on the spiro robot that i like are the mostion senser and the touchging sensers and the light sensers and the speed sensers 
one senser on thje robot that is alos very important is a light senser and that is souly because we need to see where the robot is and we kinda like to make funny faces on the robot and then make it do funny things for example when we where using them to infect each other we needed the faces to get all uky and gross and sick like thus we used the light senser
