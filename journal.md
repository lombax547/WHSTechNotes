mechanic  fixes vehicles and replaces their parts for customers. some of the skills needed to be a mechanic are problem solving ike being able to find the problem and fix the problem and onther is attention to detail and that helps when it comees to doing a good job on the body becasue you would not wan tto give the customer back there car and there is dents in the body work and there are holes in the panal's and dirt and grime so the best thing to do is look at the car when it comes in and make sure that it stays that way when it leave smae thing for your work make ssur eif your doing a wireing job mak esure that you make the wires look pretty becaus eall that matters to the custimer and if you treat here stuff like it dose not matter well they are not going to come back to you anoher thing that really really matter is customer service and the reason why that matters so much is simply becase you want money well in order to get that you need to treat customers the same way you would want to be treated like feel there problems and you know be nice to them and aother thing is communication nothing gets done the right way or nothing gets done at all because you team mate dose not know what to do becaue they dont know where the problem is and they may work o the side of the car or part that is not even broken and can casue more prolbems thats why communication is so importat

so some reasons why following instructions are so important is simple because to get the best effect on a project or a assighnment it makse things easirer on the teacher and it is just important and you want a hugh grade it helps with that too and you make less mistakes when you follow the instuctions given by the teacher and you can gain more privlges and more that comes with that and thats what you want so folling instructions is very important so for example say your in a fire and a fire fighter gives you a set of instrcutions and those set of instructions mean your life you kinda need to use those insturction that he gave you and those instructions were take the left stair case top my left and go all thye way down across the street to the red mark and wait there for assistance so say you follow the first few steps like going down the stair case and you choose to goto the mcdonalds down the street one you may pass of becasue so  much smoke in your lungs or the officers may need toi collect a statement from you but say that you don't follow the first few steps and you go down the right staircase instaed of the left well friend you just killed yourself instructions are important!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

some sensers on the spiro robot that i like are the mostion senser and the touchging sensers and the light sensers and the speed sensers 
one senser on thje robot that is alos very important is a light senser and that is souly because we need to see where the robot is and we kinda like to make funny faces on the robot and then make it do funny things for example when we where using them to infect each other we needed the faces to get all uky and gross and sick like thus we used the light senser
