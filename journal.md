so some reasons why following instructions are so important is simple because to get the best effect on a project or a assighnment it makse things easirer on the teacher and it is just important and you want a hugh grade it helps with that too and you make less mistakes when you follow the instuctions given by the teacher and you can gain more privlges and more that comes with that and thats what you want so folling instructions is very important so for example say your in a fire and a fire fighter gives you a set of instrcutions and those set of instructions mean your life you kinda need to use those insturction that he gave you and those instructions were take the left stair case top my left and go all thye way down across the street to the red mark and wait there for assistance so say you follow the first few steps like going down the stair case and you choose to goto the mcdonalds down the street one you may pass of becasue so  much smoke in your lungs or the officers may need toi collect a statement from you but say that you don't follow the first few steps and you go down the right staircase instaed of the left well friend you just killed yourself instructions are important!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

some sensers on the spiro robot that i like are the mostion senser and the touchging sensers and the light sensers and the speed sensers 
one senser on thje robot that is alos very important is a light senser and that is souly because we need to see where the robot is and we kinda like to make funny faces on the robot and then make it do funny things for example when we where using them to infect each other we needed the faces to get all uky and gross and sick like thus we used the light senser
